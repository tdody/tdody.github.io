My name is Thibault Dody. I am a lead engineer with a strong background in mathematics. My current work focuses on performing risk analysis for nuclear power plants. We perform probability risk assessment related to external aggressions such as seismic, tornado missiles or floods.<br>

I completed my <b>MEng</b> at MIT with a <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/82709" target="_blank">thesis</a> focused on applying numerical optimization techniques to reduce the impact of earthquakes on buildings. Before coming to MIT, I studied mathematics and physics as part of the preparatory <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles" target="_blank">program</a> to enter French engineering schools. I then joined the <b>MSc</b> program at the <a href="https://www.estp.fr/en" target="_blank">ESTP</a> school in Paris to study structural engineering.<br>
