# ABOUT ME

My name is Thibault Dody. I am a data scientist with a strong background in mathematics and engineering.<br>

I am currently a Senior Data Scientist at <a href="https://faraday.ai/" target="_blank">Faraday</a>. I research, develop, and maintain machine learning models to help companies better understand their customers. I also work on developing new features and improving the performance of the existing models. In the recent years, my focus has been on propensity models, bias detection and mitigation, and recommender engines.<br>

Previously, I worked on identifying signals of potential harm and threats found in billions of digital conversations each day. Prior to this, I focused on performing risk analysis for nuclear power plants. These assessments were related to external aggressions such as seismic, tornado missiles or floods.<br>

I completed my <b>MEng</b> at MIT with a <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/82709" target="_blank">thesis</a> focused on applying numerical optimization techniques to reduce the impact of earthquakes on buildings. Before joining the MIT program, I studied mathematics and physics as part of the preparatory <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classe_pr%C3%A9paratoire_aux_grandes_%C3%A9coles" target="_blank">program</a> to enter French engineering schools. I then joined the <b>MSc</b> program at the <a href="https://www.estp.fr/en" target="_blank">ESTP</a> school in Paris to study structural engineering.<br>
