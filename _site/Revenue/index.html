<h1 id="revenue-prediction">Revenue Prediction</h1>

<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>

<p>The available dataset consists of a set of json files. Each json file contains the monthly transaction of our company.<br />
The objective is to predict the total revenue generated during the 30 days following an input date.</p>

<p>The focus on this project is to develop and efficient and useful workflow. The project stats with an <a href="https://github.com/tdody/RevenueModel/blob/master/notebooks/Part_1_EDA.ipynb">EDA</a>, different models are then <a href="https://github.com/tdody/RevenueModel/blob/master/notebooks/Part_2_Models.ipynb">tested</a>.</p>

<p>My main objective through this project was to build and deploy a model and an associated API.<br />
The python code is available in my <a href="https://github.com/tdody/RevenueModel">Github repository</a>.</p>

<p>For the deployment of this model, I have chosen the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Build a flask app to create a web interface.</li>
  <li>Build a Docker container for future use.</li>
  <li>Deploy a live version using Heroku</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>A live version can be accessed <a href="https://revenue-ml.herokuapp.com/">here</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The loading of the app can take a few seconds if Heroku needs to restart the build.</p>

<h2 id="api">API</h2>

<h3 id="prediction">Prediction</h3>

<p>Two inputs are used for the prediction:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A country (if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">all</code> is used then the predicted revenue encompasses all markets).</li>
  <li>A date for which to compute our future revenue.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="training">Training</h3>

<p>The API allows the user to re-train a model for a specific country. This useful feature can help keep the model up to date with new data.</p>

<h3 id="logs">Logs</h3>

<p>In order to monitor our model performance and trainings, two logs are kept up-to-date every time our models are trained or used for prediction.</p>
