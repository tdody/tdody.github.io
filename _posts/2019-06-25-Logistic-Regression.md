# Logistic Regression

This post is part of a three-post series on the topic of Deep Learning. The first part will cover the fundamentals of optimization and more precisely, the logistic regression and its implementation in Python. The second post will cover the basis of layered model. The final post will cover the implementation of a deep neural network.

## 1. Theory
  
The idea behind the logistic regression is to build a linear model (similar to a simple linear regression) in order to predict a binary outcome (0 or 1).

In order to implement a logistic regression, two functions are needed. The first one is a simple linear function ($$L$$) coupled with the sigmoid function ($$\sigma$$). They are defined as:

$$L(x) = b + \sum_{n=1}^{N} w_{n} * x_{n} $$
  
and

$$\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$$

Before we dive deeper into these notions, let's define a few notations:

1. The $$w$$'s are called the **weights** of the model. The $$b$$ is commonly called the bias.
2. The input example $$x$$ is a n-dimension vector.

The input for our model are defined as:

1. A set of $$m$$ examples $$\{x_{1},...,x_{m}\}$$
2. A set of $$m$$ targets $$\{y_{1},...,y_{m}\}$$ where $$y_{i}=0\ or\ 1$$

The goal is to find the $$\beta$$ of the linear function is order to make the best predictions. A prediction is defined as:

$$a = \sigma(z)\ where\ z=b + \sum_{n=1}^{N} w_{n} * x_{n}$$  

Indeed the output of the sigmoid function can be interpreted as the probability of the prediction to be either 0 or 1. In order to visualize it, let's plot the sigmoid function.


```python
# create sigmoid function 
z = np.arange(-10,10,0.1)
y = 1 / (1+np.exp(-z))

# plot sigmoid
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,6))

ax.plot(z,y)
ax.set_xlabel('z')
ax.set_ylabel('y')
ax.set_title('Sigmoid function: $\sigma(x)=1/(1+e^{-z})$');
```

<figure>
    <a href="https://tdody.github.io/assets/img/2019-06-24-Logistic-Regression/output_5_0.png"><img src="https://tdody.github.io/assets/img/2019-06-24-Logistic-Regression/output_5_0.png"></a>
</figure>


The sigmoid function is defined on the entire range of real numbers and takes values in [0,1]. Therefore, if the output of the linear function is a large value, then the sigmoid will be close to 1 and close to 0 if z is very small. There is one missing aspect to our model. The goal is to predict whether y is equal to 0 or 1, to do so, we will define a threshold.  

$$y_{pred}=1\ if\ a\geq0.5\ else\ y_{pred}=0$$  
  
Finally, we need to define a performance metric in order to assess how well our model behaves. We call this metric the **Loss Function**. It represents how close are out predictions to the actual values. The loss function is defined as:
  
$$L(x)=-log(a)*y-log(1-a)*(1-y)$$


```python
# create sigmoid function 
x = np.arange(0.00001,0.999999,0.00001)
y_1 = -np.log(x)
y_2 = -np.log(1-x)

# plot sigmoid
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,6))

ax.plot(x,y_1,label="y=1")
ax.plot(x,y_2,label="y=0")
ax.set_xlabel('a')
ax.set_ylabel('y')
ax.set_title('Loss function: $L(x)=-log(a)*y-log(1-a)*(1-y)$')
ax.legend();
```

</figure>


From the above plot, we see that the penalty becomes extremely large is the prediction is incorrect. For instance, if $$y=0$$ and $$y_{prob}=0.95$$, then the loss is equal to:


```python
-np.log(1-0.95)
```




    2.99573227355399



Whereas if $$y=0$$ and $$y_{prob}=0.05$$, then the loss is equal to:


```python
-np.log(1-0.05)
```




    0.05129329438755058



Finally, we define the **Cost Function** as the average of the **Loss Function** over the entire set of examples.  
  
$$ J = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m L(a^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$$

The last step of this section consists of the optimization step. Now that the model and the performance metric have been defined, the weights of the model need to be optimized in order to best fit the data. This is where the **gradient descent** comes into play. The idea behind the optimization is to look at how the performance varies as a function of the weights. To do so, the partial derivatives (slops) of the **Cost Function** are computed.

$$ \frac{\partial J}{\partial w_{i}}\ and\ \frac{\partial J}{\partial b}$$


Each parameter is then updated using:

$$ \theta_{i} = w_{i} - \alpha*\frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta{i}}$$
  
Where $$\alpha$$ is a constant called **learning** rate.
  
Based on our definition of the loss, we have:

$$ \frac{\partial J}{\partial w} = \frac{1}{m}X(A-Y)^T$$  

$$ \frac{\partial J}{\partial b} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m (a^{(i)}-y^{(i)})$$
  
Based on the formulas presented above, it is necessary to obtain A (vector of predicted probabilities) in order to obtain the gradients. Therefore, the optimization is before as a two step process:

1. Forward propagation: Make predictions using current parameters and compute cost
2. Backward propagation: Use predictions to compute gradients and update parameters

## 2. Implementation in Python

The functions below are used to define the logistic regression model. They are defined as follows:
1. `sigmoid`: Simple mathematical function used to apply the sigmoid function to a number or an array.
2. `initialize_with_zeros`: Creates a vector of zeros of shape (dim, 1) for w and initializes b to 0
3. `propagate`: Computes the cost function and its gradient for the forward propagation
4. `optimize`: Optimizes w and b by running a gradient descent algorithm
5. `predict`: Makes a prediction based on a given input 
6. `model`: Builds the logistic regression model


```python

    Arguments:
    z -- A scalar or numpy array of any size.

## 3. Data  

We use sklearn data generator to create a set of inputs (X) with two input features.


```python
# Create data
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=200, n_features=2,
                                            n_informative=2, n_redundant=0,
                                            n_repeated=0, n_classes=2,
                                            n_clusters_per_class=1,
                                            weights=None, flip_y=0.05,
                                            class_sep=0.98, hypercube=True,
                                            shift=2.0, scale=1.0,
                                            shuffle=True, random_state=15)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.10, random_state=30)

X = X.T
y = y.T
X_train = X_train.T
X_test = X_test.T
y_train = y_train.T.reshape(1,-1)
y_test = y_test.T.reshape(1,-1)
```


```python
# Visualize the data:
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8,8))
plt.scatter(X[0, :], X[1, :], c=y, s=40, cmap=plt.cm.Spectral);
```


<figure>
    <a href="https://tdody.github.io/assets/img/2019-06-24-Logistic-Regression/output_25_0.png"><img src="https://tdody.github.io/assets/img/2019-06-24-Logistic-Regression/output_25_0.png"></a>
</figure>



```python
# data shapes
print("X_train: {}".format(X_train.shape))
print("X_test: {}".format(X_test.shape))
print("y_train: {}".format(y_train.shape))
print("y_test: {}".format(y_test.shape))
```

    X_train: (2, 180)
    X_test: (2, 20)
    y_train: (1, 180)
    y_test: (1, 20)
    

The dataset consists of 200 records (180 are used in the training set). Each record belongs to a class (0 or 1). A logistic regression model is training on the data.

An important step of the analysis consists of understanding the distribution of the data across the various classes. The distribution establish a benchmark accuracy for our model. For instance, if our data is evenly distributed between two classes then our benchmark value (accuracy from a dummy classifier) will be 50%. But if our data was unevenly distributed 90%/10% then the benchmark would be defined as 90%.


```python
# data distribution
unique_elements, counts_elements = np.unique(y, return_counts=True)
print("Frequency of unique values of y:")
print(np.asarray((unique_elements, counts_elements)))

unique_elements, counts_elements = np.unique(y_train, return_counts=True)
print("\nFrequency of unique values of y_train:")
print(np.asarray((unique_elements, counts_elements)))

unique_elements, counts_elements = np.unique(y_test, return_counts=True)
print("\nFrequency of unique values of y_test:")
print(np.asarray((unique_elements, counts_elements)))
```

    Frequency of unique values of y:
    [[  0   1]
     [ 99 101]]
    
    Frequency of unique values of y_train:
    [[ 0  1]
     [89 91]]
    
    Frequency of unique values of y_test:
    [[ 0  1]
     [10 10]]
    

From the matrices above, the data appears evenly distributed for all sets (full, train, and test).

## 4. Simple Logistic Regression  


```python
d = model(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test, num_iterations = 2000, learning_rate = 0.5, print_cost = True)
```

    Cost after iteration 0: 0.693147
    Cost after iteration 100: 0.287603
    Cost after iteration 200: 0.281655
    Cost after iteration 300: 0.279128
    Cost after iteration 400: 0.277851
    Cost after iteration 500: 0.277187
    Cost after iteration 600: 0.276836
    Cost after iteration 700: 0.276647
    Cost after iteration 800: 0.276546
    Cost after iteration 900: 0.276490
    Cost after iteration 1000: 0.276460
    Cost after iteration 1100: 0.276443
    Cost after iteration 1200: 0.276434
    Cost after iteration 1300: 0.276428
    Cost after iteration 1400: 0.276426
    Cost after iteration 1500: 0.276424
    Cost after iteration 1600: 0.276423
    Cost after iteration 1700: 0.276423
    Cost after iteration 1800: 0.276422
    Cost after iteration 1900: 0.276422
    train accuracy: 90.56 %
    test accuracy: 95.00 %
    

The cost seems to plateau after 1100 iterations. The accuracy on the test set is **95%** while the accuracy on the train set is **91%**. Overall, the logistic regression performed well on this simple test case.


```python
# Visualize the data:

ax.plot(list(range(0,2000,100)), d['costs'])

TAD_tools.plot_confusion_matrix(y_test.T, predict(d['w'], d['b'], X_test).T,
                                classes=np.array([str(x) for x in range(2)]),

Confusion matrices can be used to identify recurring misclassification. For instance, the logistic regression makes more errors when the true label is 1 than when it is 4. In our example, it does not really matter since the data was randomly generated. However, when working on a real dataset, this pattern can indicate a need for improvement of the model (more data,...).


```python
TAD_tools.plot_decision_boundary_train_test(lambda x: predict(d['w'], d['b'], x.T),
                                            X_train, y_train.T.ravel(),
                                            X_test, y_test.T.ravel())
```

Finally, we now generate a few datasets with complex decision boundaries. The idea is to test the ability of the logistic regression to adapt to more complex situations.

```python
n_samples = 300
outliers_fraction = 0.15
n_outliers = int(outliers_fraction * n_samples)
n_inliers = n_samples - n_outliers
```


```python
blobs_params = dict(random_state=0, n_samples=n_inliers, n_features=2)
datasets = [
    make_blobs(centers=[[0, 0], [0, 0]], cluster_std=0.3,
               **blobs_params),
    make_circles(n_samples=400, factor=.3, noise=.05, random_state=10),
    make_blobs(centers=[[1, 1], [0, 0]], cluster_std=[0.7, 2.0],
               **blobs_params),
    make_moons(n_samples=n_samples, noise=.05, random_state=0)]
```


```python
# Visualize the data:
fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(10,10))

for row in range(2):
    for col in range(2):
        axs[row,col].scatter(datasets[2*row+col][0][:, 0],
                             datasets[2*row+col][0][:, 1],
                             c=datasets[2*row+col][1],
                             s=40,
                             cmap=plt.cm.Spectral)
        axs[row,col].set_title("Dataset {}:".format(2*row+col));
```

```python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(2,2,figsize=(10,10))

for i, dataset in enumerate(datasets):
    row = i//2
    col = i%2
    
    X = dataset[0]
    y = dataset[1]
    
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.10, random_state=30)

    X, y = X.T, y.T
    X_train, X_test = X_train.T, X_test.T
    y_train, y_test = y_train.T.reshape(1,-1), y_test.T.reshape(1,-1)
    
    print("\nDataset {}:".format(i))
    d = model(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test, num_iterations = 2000, learning_rate = 0.5, print_cost = False)
    
    TAD_tools.plot_decision_boundary(lambda x: predict(d['w'], d['b'], x.T), X, y, title="Dataset {}:".format(i),ax=axs[row,col])
```

    
    Dataset 0:
    train accuracy: 55.90 %
    test accuracy: 30.77 %
    
    Dataset 1:
    train accuracy: 31.11 %
    test accuracy: 37.50 %

    train accuracy: 79.04 %
    test accuracy: 57.69 %

As shown above, when boundaries between classes are not linear, the logistic regression does not perform well (as expected). However, the principle behind linear classification can be used and combined in order to make more complex model. A new type of model combining the efficiency of the logistic regression and a non-linear aspect is the natural next step towards deep learning.

## 5. Conclusion  

### Pros
1. Simple to implement.
2. Few hyperparameters.
3. Easy to interpret and visualize (up to three dimensions).
4. Works for both binary and multi-class classification.
5. Can be upgraded with regularization (Ridge or Lasso)

### Cons
1. Works well if data relationships are linear.
2. Too simple to capture complex relationships.

In conclusion, a logistic regression can be seen as the first step of the path to a more complex model. It is often use as a mean to assess the complexity of a problem and obtain quick and rough results.

In part of this series, we will cover the basic of deep learning and how we can leverage the basics of the logistic regression to implement more complex models.
