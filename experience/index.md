## Jensen Hughes, Lead Engineer  

*Jun 2013 – Oct 2020*  

Most of my work at Jensen Hughes involved performing statistical risk analysis for nuclear power plants. Due to the technical nature of the work and the relative niche of the industry, we often had to develop our own tools and software.
In addition, I co-founded the Data Automation and Machine Learning Team and led projects to improve engineering efficiency through automation and predictive modeling.  

### Key Projects  

- **Seismic Data Processing Software:** Designed and developed tools for seismic data analysis.
- **Predictive Maintenance Database:** Built SQL-driven solutions for power plant equipment optimization.
- **Piping Analysis Application:** Led development of a .NET-based tool for pipeline system assessments.  

**Skills**: SQL · Python · VBA · .NET
